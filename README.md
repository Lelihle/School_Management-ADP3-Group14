Problem Statement 

In the quest for seamless and effective organisational processes in a college, the technology
department of the college has been given the task to digitize and automate its academic-facing
processes.

Requirements For Assignment

1. Create a Maven Java project called school_management.

2. In the root package of your project, create domain, factory, repository and service packages.

3. Use the appropriate design pattern where necessary.
 
4. Use helper classes and methods for re-occurring functionalities.

5. Consider the abstraction and adoption of good packaging principles in your project.

Improvements that could be made to the assignment.
- Normalized Tables for UML diagram.
- Read,Update,Delete anomalies.
- Flawed design = more expensive and complex to handle .
- Loose coupling instead of tightly coupling to make entities dependable.
- The entities on the UML are tightly connected, which means they are reliant on one another, limiting their flexibility. 
- Instead of being a value object, Address should have been a complete entity. This would allow StudentAddress and EmployeeAddress to act as a bridge entity, as it   should when two Entities share a composite key. Employee and EmployeeAddress will become an One-To-Many relationship, while Student and StudentAddress will become an One-To-Many relationship.
